# Deep Learning Crash Course
Hi all! In this notebook, we'll be making a simple neural network from scratch in pytorch.
After following along with the code, you will have a simple understanding of
* Why and when to use `torch.tensor` objects
* How to create a `Dataset` and `Dataloader` in torch
* How to create a simple multilayer perceptron in torch
* How to train a model with torch
